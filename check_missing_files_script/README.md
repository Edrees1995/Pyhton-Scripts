# Check Missing Files Script

## Overview

This Python script helps you check for missing files within a specified range in a folder. It's a handy tool for verifying if certain files are present or not.

## Installation

1. Clone the Pyhton-Scripts repository to your local machine:

   
   git clone https://github.com/Edrees1995/Pyhton-Scripts.git
   

2. Navigate to the "check_missing_files_script" folder:

   
   cd Pyhton-Scripts/check_missing_files_script
   

## Usage

To run the script, make sure you're in the "check_missing_files_script" folder:


python check_missing_files.py


The script will prompt you to enter the following information:

- Folder path: Enter the path to the folder where you want to check for missing files.
- Minimum file number: Enter the minimum file number in the expected range.
- Maximum file number: Enter the maximum file number in the expected range.

The script will then compare the range of expected file numbers with the files in the specified folder and display a list of any missing files.

## Example

Suppose you have a folder containing video files named from "1.mp4" to "10.mp4," but some files are missing. Running the script with the correct range will identify the missing files:


Enter the folder path where your video files are located: /path/to/your/folder
Enter the minimum file number: 1
Enter the maximum file number: 10

Missing files:
2.mp4
4.mp4
7.mp4
